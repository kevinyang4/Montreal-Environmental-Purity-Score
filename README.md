## Inspiration
Our inspiration was to help people understand their current contribution to the environment and help them improve by increasing their hero score!

## What it does
Our project is a web application that quizzes the user on their environmental activities. Using the data collected from Montreal Open Data, as well as other datasets, we were able to attribute a purity score to each question and give a Montreal Environmental Purity Score (MEPS).

## How we built it
First, we analyzed the data from different datasets using Python libraries such as numpy and matplotlib. Using these data we created an algorithm that would attribute a score to an answer depending on its relation to the datasets. We then utilized our software engineering skills and the FastAPI and React framework to create a web application that would be able to host the quiz and provide a fun UI/UX to the user.

## Challenges we ran into
The most challenging, yet fun obstacle was to find an interesting question that can be answered in a unique way. There were many interesting datasets to choose from but the environmental aspect of the project resonated with our values as well as DRW's! Our team is like a superhero squad where everyone brings their own unique power to the table - from software engineering to math whizzes, computer science buffs, and actuarial science aces. It's like assembling a dream team for the ultimate project! We decided to tackle the DRW challenge, where each of us could unleash our talents and really sparkle as we dive into the thrilling journey of project development.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to participate to our first hackathon and provide a functioning MVP!

## What we learned
We learned the intricacies of data analysis and the development cycle of a project from scratch
